# Jaipur
Jaipur is a two-player card game won by selling and taking goods from the market to maximise points, has elements of chance and competing goals. I re-create the game using Python and attempt to build agents that will select optimal moves using MiniMax and Alpha Beta pruning. For simplicity I have assumed that both players possess information of the opponents hands and deck orders, the nature of the game is Stochastic and will require more advanced strategies to account for randomness.
